# Initiative Canvas

Single page business model template (canvas) for administrative initiatives.

A tool to help qualify ideas (potential administrative initiatives) prior to investing significant resources.

How it works:
 * encourage people with ideas to consider them from a number of important perspectives
 * provide decision makers with compact and expressive descriptions

Search the internet for "Business Model Canvas" and to see where this concept comes from. Specifically, I took the "Lean Canvas" and refactored the right hand side to reflect a government context (rather than business context). The left side (product context) is was only lightly tweaked; yes, it's a shameless rip-off.
